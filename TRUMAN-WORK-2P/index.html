                    <p>In his home, right after his wife and mother left him to watch his favourite show, the spokesman expresses that there's no place like seahaven, psychologicaly manipulating him to never desire to leave his town.<p>ㅤ</p>
                    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Radio(H0:04:02)</b></font></p>
                    <p>While Truman is driving to work, the radio broadcast indirectly speaks with him, subtly connecting on both his actions and connects.<p>ㅤ</p>
                    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>NewsPaper(H0:05:45)</b></font></p>
                    <p>While Truman was working, his colleague show him that day's newspaper, with the frontpagye saying "The best place on earth - Seahaven", giving him more reasons to never want to leave that place<p>ㅤ</p>

                    <p>Used by Truman to try and remake the love of his life face.<p>ㅤ</p>

                <h1>what kind of a movie it is</h1>
                <p>This movie is a movie inside another movie, it is a comedy because it can make you</p>
                <p>laught and it can be considered a science fiction because beliving or not, this movie </p>
                <p>shows another point of view into this world</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide" id="slide3">
                <h1>What the movie represents</h1>
                <p>This movie represents a simulation of a life of a normal person that in this case is, </p>
                <p>that is followed from his birth to the point that he escapes and this movie can represent 
                <p>life too because we dont know if we are manipulated or not, if we are beeing watched and 
                <p>followed or not, we dont really know if this is the true reality that we are living or 
                <p>just a simulation that we dont know that we live in.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide" id="slide4">
                <h1>the means of comunication you can see within the movie</h1>
                <p>The means in the comunication are mostly to manipulate Truman, so he doesn't travel 
                <p>to another country or city because they want him to stay and every type of comunication 
                <p>is designed to scare him of goint to another place like the poster with the airplane beeing 
                <p>struch by a lightning and saying "it could happen to you" and the radio always tries to manipulate 
                <p>Truman to stay in his city like saying everytime that the weather is always good and that it is the 
                <p>greatest city</p>

            <div class="slide" id="slide5">
                <h1>Are these normal Media? Are they Manipulated? Are Media in general the same as in the movie?</h1>
                <p>The answer to this question depends on what each person considers to be normal. For instance, if for someone "normal" is what's presented to them, then the general media, presented both in the movie and in real life are normal. But if normal is considered the truth, then what's shown in the movie is odd, as they're actively omitting the truth. </p>

                <h1>Give your opinion on the following sentence:</h1>
                <!-- <em> PÕE O TEXTO ITÁLICO-->
                <p><em>"We Accept the reality of the world with witch we are presented"</em></p>
                <p>The reality of the world on which each person lives in is shapped by their prespective on things.  As an example, if a person were to be born in an Islamic country, it would've been common to see women covered, due to their religion. Altho that isn't unseen in our world, it isn't very common either, but it exists nonetheless.</p>
